# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Project2: FLACK
APP ORGANISATION
Flack is a simple chat application that allows many users to be hooked to a socket for chatting.
Users will make use of the application by typing in their preferred display name, create a channel for chatting or join an existing one. Users are also allowed to leave a channel to another one or create a new one and start chatting there.
The application is smart enough to remember the username and the last channel a user visited if he/she closes the browser.
File sharing is also supported by the application.
FILE ORGANISATION
The application contains the following files:
1.	The application.py file which is the main python file of the application. It contains the server side logic of the application.
2.	Script.js: a javascript file containing the client side logic
3.	Chat.js file which serves as a supporting file for script.js
4.	Layout.html containing the template used by the application
5.	Index.html: A HTML file that renders the application
6.	Requirements.txt: The file containing the relevant and required python libraries for the project.
